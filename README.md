## Description

This project is a tile-based maze game built using p5.js. Based on the "Week 4 Example 3" curriculum, it demonstrates how to separate game data from game logic by loading level designs from an external JSON file.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Uses "preload()" and "loadJSON" to import level configurations.
- The "Level" class iterates through arrays to draw walls, floors, and hazards.
- Implements a "Lava" tile (Red).
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)
